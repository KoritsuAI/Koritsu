> **Koritsu** (効率) - Japanese for "efficiency" - represents the next generation in autonomous AI orchestration systems, embodying the concept of _kaizen_ (改善) - continuous improvement.

## 🌌 Vision: _Mirai_ (未来)

Koritsu represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence architecture. Unlike traditional AI systems constrained by predefined capabilities, Koritsu dynamically evolves its own cognitive framework through autonomous agent generation and seamless _kyōryoku_ (協力) collaboration protocols.

The system leverages a minimal _kaku_ (核) architecture that expands organically based on real-world challenges, creating a truly adaptive _chishiki_ (知識) matrix that grows more sophisticated with each interaction.
